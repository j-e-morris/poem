Roses are red
Violets are blue
I forget how this poem actually goes
How about you?

It's been a long time
Several years in fact
Since I've written a poem
So here's my best act.

That last rhyme above
Felt very lame
So here I'll try again
Hoping the result's not the same.

This poem is dragging
It's feeling quite long
I suppose I shall end now
Before I do more wrong.
